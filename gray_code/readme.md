Gray code generator
// .cbp files IDE codeblocks
// creates a file with the Gray code orderly codes, for quantity requested in program arguments
// creates file_name.txt with the code, with file_name as name requested in program arguments
// program arguments order doesn't really matter
// highest Gray code that works - 16, rather doubt that more will be ever needed
